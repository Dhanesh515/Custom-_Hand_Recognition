# Custom_Hand_Recognition
Sign language detection and recognition are pivotal tasks in computer vision and artificial intelligence, aiding communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
# Hand Recognition
Hand detection involves identifying and locating human hands in images or video frames. It encompasses finding the presence and location of hands within an image or a video stream. Various techniques, including MediaPipe, Haar cascades, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), along with libraries like OpenCV, are commonly used for hand detection.
# Hand Gesture Recognition
Once hands are detected, gesture recognition involves identifying specific hand configurations or movements corresponding to sign language gestures. It is a broader task that not only involves identifying the presence of hands but also recognizing the gestures and translating them into meaningful text or speech. Gesture recognition systems typically leverage machine learning models, such as CNNs, for feature extraction and classification.
